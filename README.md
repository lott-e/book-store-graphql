# Books app

Made following the tutorial [GraphQL Full Course - Novice to Expert | freecodecamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ed8SzALpx1Q&t=85s)


- We got relational data from the books using `Type Relations` within GraphQL, so we can find authors for each book when they're not actually attached within the database


### Client 
- React
- Apollo

#### Testing queries
- GraphiQL

### Server 
- Node.JS
- Express
- GraphQL
    - Loadash
